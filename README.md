# TagadaDisco
Tagada Disco Game developed for the Global Game Jam 2017

Videogame: Tagada Disco
Engine: Unreal Engine 4.14
Programming Method Used: Blueprint Only
Platform: Windows 64 bit
Plugins Used: None

We used only blueprints for this project, we used the Rolling Ball Template for pawns but we make our own inputs in the level that allow us to manipulate the actors for the game.
The game can be played with one controller or Keyboard, and was programed with that intention.

The impulse of the waves used to push the pawns is affected by the time you don't press the button that makes the wave. with a maximum time of 5 seconds for full recharge.
